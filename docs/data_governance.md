## Data governance

### Lineage

It would appear that the [Kaggle train/test datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) are derived almost certainly from the file that was at this address:
[http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/titanic3.csv](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/titanic3.csv).

There is a description of the dataset provided in the accompanying [information file](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/titanic3info.txt) which also discusses its origins.

This file has since been relocated to: [https://hbiostat.org/data/repo/titanic3.csv](https://hbiostat.org/data/repo/titanic3.csv).

## Modelling

The aim of this web app is to illustrate:
1. the importance of scrutinising data appropriately
2. the use of machine learning pipelines within the `scikit-learn` package to predict the survival of
   passengers on the Titanic
3. the impact of data errors on the predictions of such models and
4. hyperparameter tuning to get the best possible performance out of a chosen model.

For the purpose of this exercise we are only using a simple logistic regression model to perform this analysis.

Of course, "better" models exist (depending on your definition of "better"), however in this case we are holding the model constant and trying to understand the impact of changes to the data inputs (from data with known errors) to an improved (though still not necessarily correct) dataset.
